## Overview

NexReel automates the process of short video creation by leveraging AI for script generation, image synthesis, and video rendering. With built-in user authentication, a robust serverless database, and integrated AI APIs, the project provides an end-to-end solution for dynamic content generation. This README serves as both a technical guide and a documented report on the inner workings of NexReel.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Generate scripts and captions using the Gemini API
- **Dynamic Image Generation**: Create custom images with Replicate to visually complement the video narrative
- **Programmatic Video Rendering**: Use Remotion to assemble video assets into a cohesive short video
- **Robust Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and sign-in processes with Clerk
- **Scalable Database Management**: Leverage Neon's serverless PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- **Advanced Media Processing**: Utilize Assembly AI (and related APIs) for tasks such as speech-to-text conversion and audio analysis
- **Modern Frontend Development**: Build responsive, modern UIs with Next.js and TailwindCSS, enhanced with Shadcn's pre-designed components

## Tech Stack & Use Cases

### Next.js
**Purpose**: Serves as the primary framework handling both client-side rendering and backend API routes.
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### TailwindCSS
**Purpose**: Provides a utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern UIs.
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Shadcn
**Purpose**: Offers customizable UI components that integrate with TailwindCSS, speeding up front-end development.
```bash
npm install @shadcn/ui
```

### Clerk (Authentication)
**Purpose**: Manages secure user authentication, including sign-in, sign-up, and session management.
```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

### Neon (Database)
**Purpose**: Provides a serverless PostgreSQL database solution for storing user data, video metadata, and more.

Setup:
1. Create an account at [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/)
2. Set up your database and obtain the connection string
3. Use the connection string in your environment configuration

### Drizzle (ORM)
**Purpose**: Enables type-safe and efficient database queries using a modern ORM tailored for TypeScript.
```bash
npm install drizzle-orm
```

### Gemini API
**Purpose**: Utilized for natural language processing tasks, such as generating video scripts and captions.
```bash
npm install gemini-api
```

### Assembly AI
**Purpose**: Provides media processing capabilities including audio transcription and analysis.
```bash
npm install assemblyai
```

### Remotion
**Purpose**: Allows programmatic video generation using React, enabling dynamic video creation and rendering.
```bash
npm install remotion
```

### Replicate
**Purpose**: Integrates state-of-the-art image generation models to produce visuals that match the video narrative.
```bash
npm install replicate
```

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NexReel.git
cd NexReel
```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Manual Package Installation** (if setting up from scratch):
```bash
# Next.js
npx create-next-app@latest

# TailwindCSS & PostCSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Shadcn UI Components
npm install @shadcn/ui

# Clerk for Authentication
npm install @clerk/nextjs

# Neon & PostgreSQL Client
npm install pg

# Drizzle ORM for Database Operations
npm install drizzle-orm

# Gemini API for Script Generation
npm install gemini-api

# Assembly AI for Media Processing
npm install assemblyai

# Remotion for Video Rendering
npm install remotion

# Replicate for Image Generation
npm install replicate
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL=your_drizzle_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_public_api_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_public_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_private_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
CAPTION_API=your_caption_api_key
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_key
```

These environment variables are crucial for:
- Database connectivity via Drizzle and Neon
- User authentication through Clerk
- Interfacing with AI services (Gemini API, Assembly AI, Replicate, etc.)
- Other platform-specific integrations like Firebase and captioning services

## Usage

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see NexReel in action.

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Video Generation Workflow
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login/sign-up handled by Clerk
2. **Content Generation**: The Gemini API generates scripts and captions based on user input
3. **Asset Creation**: Replicate creates tailored images, while Assembly AI processes audio inputs
4. **Video Rendering**: Remotion compiles these assets into a final video
5. **Data Management**: All user data and video metadata are stored securely in the Neon database, accessed via Drizzle
